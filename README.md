# Termux:

## Recommended to have an arm-32 upto date termux from official GitHub to avoid issues like phantom killing (Android 12 has a background process limiter called the Phantom Process Killer that kills app processes that use too many CPU resources or system resources. This can cause the error "Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter" in Termux.), etc.
